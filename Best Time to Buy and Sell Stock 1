Example 1:

Input: prices = [7,1,5,3,6,4]
Output: 5
Explanation: Buy on day 2 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 6), profit = 6-1 = 5.
Note that buying on day 2 and selling on day 1 is not allowed because you must buy before you sell.
Example 2:

Input: prices = [7,6,4,3,1]
Output: 0
Explanation: In this case, no transactions are done and the max profit = 0.


class Solution {
public:
    int maxProfit(vector<int>& prices) {
         int maxProfit=0;
         int minimumNumber=prices[0];
         for(int i=0;i<prices.size();i++){
            int curr=prices[i]- minimumNumber;
            maxProfit=max(maxProfit,curr);
             minimumNumber=min( minimumNumber,prices[i]);
         } 
         return maxProfit;
    }
};
